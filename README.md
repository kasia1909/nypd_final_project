# nypd_final_project
my final project
My project explores cancer and various risk factors across the globe using the Cancer Atlas 3ed and Python. 
It has five modules, four of which contain different functions for exploring different data about cancer and risk factors.
The fifth is an attempt at unittesting the code.
Each function has help information. 
My final report is also included in the github repository. 
My profiler results are available at the end of main.ipynb.
